# üß± Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture

Choosing the right architecture is critical when building scalable backend systems. Let‚Äôs compare **Monolithic** and **Microservice** architectures and understand where each fits best.

---

## üîπ Monolithic Architecture

A **monolith** is a single application where all business logic, frontend, and backend reside in one codebase and are deployed as one unit.

### ‚úÖ Example:
- Single WAR file with user module, admin module, and product module all together.

### üîß Pros:
| Advantage                   | Why It Helps                                      |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Easy to develop             | Single codebase, simple to get started            |
| Easy deployment             | One build, one deploy                             |
| Simple testing              | Test all parts in one place                       |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons:
| Limitation                  | Problem It Causes                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Hard to scale independently | Can‚Äôt scale only one part (e.g., payments)        |
| Long deploy cycles          | Small change ‚Üí full redeploy                      |
| Harder to maintain          | Codebase grows big and tightly coupled            |

## üîπ Microservices Architecture

A **microservice** is a small, self-contained service that owns a single business capability and communicates with other services via APIs.

### ‚úÖ Example:
- `UserService`, `ProductService`, `PaymentService` run independently on different ports.

### üîß Pros:
| Advantage                        | Why It Helps                                |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Independent deployment           | Deploy services separately                  |
| Scalable by service              | Scale high-traffic services only            |
| Tech freedom per service         | Each team can choose different stack        |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons:
| Limitation                       | Problem It Causes                           |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Complex communication            | Needs API Gateway or service registry       |
| Higher DevOps effort             | Needs Docker, monitoring, tracing, etc.     |
| Data consistency challenges      | Harder to maintain ACID across services     |

## üîÑ Comparison Table

| Feature             | Monolith                          | Microservices                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Codebase            | Single                            | Multiple, smaller repos            |
| Deployment          | One app/package                   | Separate services & containers     |
| Scalability         | All or nothing                    | Per service                        |
| Technology          | Usually uniform                   | Polyglot (can vary by service)     |
| DevOps complexity   | Low                               | High (needs monitoring, CI/CD)     |
| Fault Isolation     | Weak (one bug = app crash)        | Strong (one service can restart)   |

## üì¶ When to Use What?

| Scenario                              | Recommended Architecture          |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Small startup MVP                     | ‚úÖ Monolith                       |
| Enterprise-level app with teams       | ‚úÖ Microservices                  |
| Need fast prototyping                 | ‚úÖ Monolith                       |
| Need high scalability & resilience    | ‚úÖ Microservices                  |
